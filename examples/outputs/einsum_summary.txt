Model: einsum_fail.onnx
TensorRT Version: 8.6

Node: Einsum_0
Status: rewrite_supported

Why it fails:
- Einsum is not natively supported by TensorRT

Prevention:
- Can be rewritten as batched MatMul

Suggested fixes:
1. Rewrite Einsum → MatMul (recommended)
2. Write TensorRT plugin (medium effort)
3. Fallback to ONNX Runtime
